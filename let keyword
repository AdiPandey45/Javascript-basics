The let keyword in JavaScript is used to declare variables. It was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and provides several key features and improvements over the older var keyword. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. Block Scope
Variables declared with let are limited to the block, statement, or expression where they are defined. A block is typically defined by {} (curly braces).

Example:
 
{
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10  
}
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined  

The variable x exists only within the {} block.

2. No Hoisting (or Limited Hoisting)
Variables declared with let are hoisted, but they are not initialized until their definition is encountered. This creates a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ), where accessing the variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError.

Example: 

console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a = 5;

3. Reassignment Allowed
You can reassign a value to a variable declared with let.

Example:

let a = 10;
a = 20;
console.log(a); // 20

4. Cannot Be Redeclared in the Same Scope
Unlike var, you cannot redeclare a variable declared with let in the same scope.

Example:

let a = 5;
let a = 10; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared

5. Useful in Loops
The let keyword is particularly useful in for loops because it creates a new scope for each iteration.

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2
}
console.log(i); // ReferenceError: i is not defined
With let, the loop variable i exists only within the loop block.

Comparison with var
Feature	var	let
Scope	Function or global	Block
Hoisting	Yes, initialized as undefined	Yes, but TDZ applies
Redeclaration	Allowed	Not allowed
Use in Loops	Same variable reused	New variable per iteration
When to Use let
Use let when the value of a variable may change over time.
It ensures proper scoping and avoids common bugs caused by var's global or function scope.
Example Use Case

function printNumbers() {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), i * 1000); // 1, 2, 3 (each printed after 1, 2, 3 seconds)
  }
}

printNumbers();
If var were used, all the timeouts would print 4 because var does not create a new scope for each iteration. Using let avoids this issue.
